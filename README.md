# Activity Summary
A python server that accepts multiple client connections using Python's built in Socket and Thread library

# Prerequisuites 
Must Have the following installed
- Python

# Instructions to run program
- Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/iPinguu/PHR-Prj1.git`
`cd PHR-Prj1 `

open two separate terminals, one for the Server.py and one for the Client.py

Execute Server.py first, then execute the Client.py

Since this activity requires the server to accept multiple connections, just open more terminals and 
exectute the Client.py on each to simulate multiple users connecting to the server. 
<br /><br />

<b>Important note</b><br />
I've set a limit of 5 concurrent connections, for simplicity.
